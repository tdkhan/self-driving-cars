# Self Driving Cars

This repository houses the programming exercises that accompnay the five course speacialization on **Self Driving Cars** offered by University of Toronoto on _Coursera_. The speacialization can be accessed [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars). The exercises reflect my own work and for most cases the source code  has been modified to respect the Coursera's Honor Code.

This repository will be periodically updated as I continue to progress further in the course speacialization. Exercises will be made available only when the courses are completed. The current directory structure of the repository is as follows

```
.self-driving-cars
├── README.md
├── .gitignore

    ├── Bicycle Kinematic Model
    └── Longitudinal Vehicle Model

## Note to Coursera Students
It is strongly advised to students enrolled in the course at Coursera to abide by the Coursera honor code. Please refrain from copying this code and passing it as your own work.
